In many cases, this is the API that should be used to specify how abstract model elements and\n * attributes should be represented in the view (and then later in DOM). Instances of this class are created by\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~buildModelConverter}.\n *\n * If you need more complex converters, see {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher},\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/model-to-view-converters}, {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable},\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/mapper~Mapper}.\n *\n * Using this API it is possible to create four kinds of converters:\n *\n * 1. Model element to view element converter. This is a converter that takes the model element and represents it\n * in the view.\n *\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromElement( 'paragraph' ).toElement( 'p' );\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromElement( 'image' ).toElement( 'img' );\n *\n * 2. Model attribute to view attribute converter. This is a converter that operates on model element attributes\n * and converts them to view element attributes. It is suitable for elements like `image` (`src`, `title` attributes).\n *\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromElement( 'image' ).toElement( 'img' );\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromAttribute( 'src' ).toAttribute();\n *\n * 3. Model attribute to view element converter. This is a converter that takes model attributes and represents them\n * as view elements. Elements created by this kind of converter are wrapping other view elements. Wrapped view nodes\n * correspond to model nodes had converter attribute. It is suitable for attributes like `bold`, where `bold` attribute\n * set on model text nodes is converter to `strong` view element.\n *\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromAttribute( 'bold' ).toElement( 'strong' );\n *\n * 4. Model marker to view element converter. This is a converter that converts markers from given group to view attribute element.\n * Markers, basically, are {@link module:engine/model/liverange~LiveRange} instances, that are named. In this conversion, model range is\n * converted to view range, then that view range is wrapped (or unwrapped, if range is removed) in a view attribute element.\n * To learn more about markers, see {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection}.\n *\n *\t\tconst viewSpanSearchResult = new ViewAttributeElement( 'span', { class: 'search-result' } );\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromMarker( 'searchResult' ).toElement( viewSpanSearchResult );\n *\n * It is possible to provide various different parameters for\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder#toElement}\n * and {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder#toAttribute} methods.\n * See their descriptions to learn more.\n *\n * It is also possible to {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder#withPriority change default priority}\n * of created converters to decide which converter should be fired earlier and which later. This is useful if you have\n * a general converter but also want to provide different special-case converters (i.e. given model element is converted\n * always to given view element, but if it has given attribute it is converter to other view element). For this,\n * use {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder#withPriority withPriority} right after `from...` method.\n *\n * Note that `to...` methods are \"terminators\", which means that should be the last one used in building converter.\n *\n * You can use {@link module:engine/conversion/buildviewconverter~ViewConverterBuilder}\n * to create \"opposite\" converters - from view to model.\n */\nclass ModelConverterBuilder {\n\t/**\n\t * Creates `ModelConverterBuilder` with given `dispatchers` registered to it.\n\t */\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Dispatchers to which converters will be attached.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @type {Array.<module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher>}\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._dispatchers = [];\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Contains data about registered \"from\" query.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @type {Object}\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._from = null;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Set one or more dispatchers which the built converter will be attached to.\n\t *\n\t * @chainable\n\t * @param {...module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher} dispatchers One or more dispatchers.\n\t * @returns {module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder}\n\t */\n\tfor( ...dispatchers ) {\n\t\tthis._dispatchers = dispatchers;\n\n\t\treturn this;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Registers what model element should be converted.\n\t *\n\t * @chainable\n\t * @param {String} elementName Name of element to convert.\n\t * @returns {module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder}\n\t */\n\tfromElement( elementName ) {\n\t\tthis._from = {\n\t\t\ttype: 'element',\n\t\t\tname: elementName,\n\t\t\tpriority: null\n\t\t};\n\n\t\treturn this;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Registers what model attribute should be converted.\n\t *\n\t * @chainable\n\t * @param {String} key Key of attribute to convert.\n\t * @returns {module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder}\n\t */\n\tfromAttribute( key ) {\n\t\tthis._from = {\n\t\t\ttype: 'attribute',\n\t\t\tkey: key,\n\t\t\tpriority: null\n\t\t};\n\n\t\treturn this;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Registers what type of marker should be converted.\n\t *\n\t * @chainable\n\t * @param {String} markerName Name of marker to convert.\n\t * @returns {module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder}\n\t */\n\tfromMarker( markerName ) {\n\t\tthis._from = {\n\t\t\ttype: 'marker',\n\t\t\tname: markerName,\n\t\t\tpriority: null\n\t\t};\n\n\t\treturn this;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Changes default priority for built converter.

View-to-model converters are used when external data is added to the editor, i.e. when a user pastes\n * HTML content to the editor. Then, converters are used to translate this structure, possibly removing unknown/incorrect\n * nodes, and add it to the model. Also multiple, different elements might be translated into the same thing in the\n * model, i.e. `<b>` and `<strong>` elements might be converted to `bold` attribute (even though `bold` attribute will\n * be then converted only to `<strong>` tag). Instances of this class are created by\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/buildviewconverter~buildViewConverter}.\n *\n * If you need more complex converters, see {@link module:engine/conversion/viewconversiondispatcher~ViewConversionDispatcher},\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/view-to-model-converters}, {@link module:engine/conversion/viewconsumable~ViewConsumable}.\n *\n * Using this API it is possible to create various kind of converters:\n *\n * 1.

Because of it, we need to fill all\n * empty elements which should be selectable with elements or characters called \"fillers\". Unfortunately there is no one\n * universal filler, this is why two types are uses:\n *\n * * Block filler is an element which fill block elements, like `<p>`. CKEditor uses `<br>` as a block filler during the editing,\n * as browsers do natively. So instead of an empty `<p>` there will be `<p><br></p>`. The advantage of block filler is that\n * it is transparent for the selection, so when the caret is before the `<br>` and user presses right arrow he will be\n * moved to the next paragraph, not after the `<br>`. The disadvantage is that it breaks a block, so it can not be used\n * in the middle of a line of text. The {@link module:engine/view/filler~BR_FILLER `<br>` filler} can be replaced with any other\n * character in the data output, for instance {@link module:engine/view/filler~NBSP_FILLER non-breaking space}.\n *\n * * Inline filler is a filler which does not break a line of text, so it can be used inside the text, for instance in the empty\n * `<b>` surrendered by text: `foo<b></b>bar`, if we want to put the caret there. CKEditor uses a sequence of the zero-width\n * spaces as an {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER inline filler} having the predetermined\n * {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER_LENGTH length}. A sequence is used, instead of a single character to\n * avoid treating random zero-width spaces as the inline filler. Disadvantage of the inline filler is that it is not\n * transparent for the selection. The arrow key moves the caret between zero-width spaces characters, so the additional\n * code is needed to handle the caret.\n *\n * Both inline and block fillers are handled by the {@link module:engine/view/renderer~Renderer renderer} and are not present in the\n * view.\n *\n * @module engine/view/filler\n */\n\n/**\n * `<br> filler creator.

This means\n * that changes in the model are reflected by changing the view (i.e. adding view nodes or changing attributes on view elements).\n *\n * During conversion process, `ModelConversionDispatcher` fires data-manipulation events, basing on state of the model and prepares\n * data for those events. It is important to note that the events are connected with \"change actions\" like \"inserting\"\n * or \"removing\" so one might say that we are converting \"changes\". This is in contrary to view to model conversion,\n * where we convert view nodes (the structure, not \"changes\" to the view). Note, that because changes are converted\n * and not the structure itself, there is a need to have a mapping between model and the structure on which changes are\n * reflected. To map elements during model to view conversion use {@link module:engine/conversion/mapper~Mapper}.\n *\n * The main use for this class is to listen to {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#event:change Document change event}, process it\n * and then fire specific events telling what exactly has changed. For those events, `ModelConversionDispatcher`\n * creates {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable list of consumable values} that should be handled by event\n * callbacks. Those events are listened to by model-to-view converters which convert changes done in the\n * {@link module:engine/model/model model} to changes in the {@link module:engine/view/view view}. `ModelConversionController` also checks\n * the current state of consumables, so it won't fire events for parts of model that were already consumed. This is\n * especially important in callbacks that consume multiple values. See {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable}\n * for an example of such callback.\n *\n * Although the primary usage for this class is the model-to-view conversion, `ModelConversionDispatcher` can be used\n * to build custom data processing pipelines that converts model to anything that is needed. Existing model structure can\n * be used to generate events (listening to {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#event:change Document change event} is not\n * required)\n * and custom callbacks can be added to the events (these does not have to be limited to changes in the view).\n *\n * When providing your own event listeners for `ModelConversionDispatcher` keep in mind that any callback that had\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#consume consumed} a value from consumable (and did some changes, i.e. to\n * the view) should also stop the event. This is because whenever a callback is fired it is assumed that there is something\n * to be consumed. Thanks to that approach, you do not have to test whether there is anything to consume at the beginning\n * of your listener callback.\n *\n * Example of providing a converter for `ModelConversionDispatcher`:\n *\n *\t\t// We will convert inserting \"paragraph\" model element into the model.\n *\t\tmodelDispatcher.on( 'insert:paragraph', ( evt, data, consumable, conversionApi ) => {\n *\t\t\t// Remember to consume the part of consumable.\n *\t\t\tconsumable.consume( data.item, 'insert' );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Translate position in model to position in the view.\n *\t\t\tconst viewPosition = conversionApi.mapper.toViewPosition( data.range.start );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Create a P element (note that this converter is for inserting P elements -> 'insert:paragraph').\n *\t\t\tconst viewElement = new ViewElement( 'p' );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Bind the newly created view element to model element so positions will map accordingly in future.\n *\t\t\tconversionApi.mapper.bindElements( data.item, viewElement );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Add the newly created view element to the view.\n *\t\t\tviewWriter.insert( viewPosition, viewElement );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Remember to stop the event propagation if the data.item was consumed.\n *\t\t\tevt.stop();\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Callback that \"overrides\" other callback:\n *\n *\t\t// Special converter for `linkHref` attribute added on custom `quote` element. Note, that this\n *\t\t// attribute may be the same as the attribute added by other features (link feature in this case).\n *\t\t// It might be even added by that feature! It makes sense that a part of content that is a quote is linked\n *\t\t// to an external source so it makes sense that link feature works on the custom quote element.\n *\t\t// However, we have to make sure that the attributes added by link feature are correctly converted.\n *\t\t// To block default `linkHref` conversion we have to:\n *\t\t// 1) add this callback with higher priority than link feature callback,\n *\t\t// 2) consume `linkHref` attribute add change.\n *\t\tmodelConversionDispatcher.on( 'addAttribute:linkHref:quote', ( evt, data, consumable, conversionApi ) => {\n *\t\t\tconsumable.consume( data.item, 'addAttribute:linkHref' );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Create a button that will represent the `linkHref` attribute.\n *\t\t\tlet viewSourceBtn = new ViewElement( 'a', {\n *\t\t\t\thref: data.item.getAttribute( 'linkHref' ),\n *\t\t\t\ttitle: 'source'\n *\t\t\t} );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Add a class for the button.\n *\t\t\tviewSourceBtn.addClass( 'source' );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Insert the button using writer API.\n *\t\t\t// If `addAttribute` event is fired by\n *\t\t\t// `module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher#convertInsert` it is fired\n *\t\t\t// after `data.item` insert conversion was done.

Model attribute to view element converter. This is a converter that takes model attributes and represents them\n * as view elements. Elements created by this kind of converter are wrapping other view elements. Wrapped view nodes\n * correspond to model nodes had converter attribute. It is suitable for attributes like `bold`, where `bold` attribute\n * set on model text nodes is converter to `strong` view element.\n *\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromAttribute( 'bold' ).toElement( 'strong' );\n *\n * 4. Model marker to view element converter. This is a converter that converts markers from given group to view attribute element.\n * Markers, basically, are {@link module:engine/model/liverange~LiveRange} instances, that are named. In this conversion, model range is\n * converted to view range, then that view range is wrapped (or unwrapped, if range is removed) in a view attribute element.\n * To learn more about markers, see {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection}.\n *\n *\t\tconst viewSpanSearchResult = new ViewAttributeElement( 'span', { class: 'search-result' } );\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromMarker( 'searchResult' ).toElement( viewSpanSearchResult );\n *\n * It is possible to provide various different parameters for\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder#toElement}\n * and {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder#toAttribute} methods.\n * See their descriptions to learn more.\n *\n * It is also possible to {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder#withPriority change default priority}\n * of created converters to decide which converter should be fired earlier and which later. This is useful if you have\n * a general converter but also want to provide different special-case converters (i.e. given model element is converted\n * always to given view element, but if it has given attribute it is converter to other view element). For this,\n * use {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder#withPriority withPriority} right after `from...` method.\n *\n * Note that `to...` methods are \"terminators\", which means that should be the last one used in building converter.\n *\n * You can use {@link module:engine/conversion/buildviewconverter~ViewConverterBuilder}\n * to create \"opposite\" converters - from view to model.\n */\nclass ModelConverterBuilder {\n\t/**\n\t * Creates `ModelConverterBuilder` with given `dispatchers` registered to it.\n\t */\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Dispatchers to which converters will be attached.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @type {Array.<module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher>}\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._dispatchers = [];\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Contains data about registered \"from\" query.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @type {Object}\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._from = null;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Set one or more dispatchers which the built converter will be attached to.\n\t *\n\t * @chainable\n\t * @param {...module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher} dispatchers One or more dispatchers.\n\t * @returns {module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder}\n\t */\n\tfor( ...dispatchers ) {\n\t\tthis._dispatchers = dispatchers;\n\n\t\treturn this;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Registers what model element should be converted.\n\t *\n\t * @chainable\n\t * @param {String} elementName Name of element to convert.\n\t * @returns {module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder}\n\t */\n\tfromElement( elementName ) {\n\t\tthis._from = {\n\t\t\ttype: 'element',\n\t\t\tname: elementName,\n\t\t\tpriority: null\n\t\t};\n\n\t\treturn this;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Registers what model attribute should be converted.\n\t *\n\t * @chainable\n\t * @param {String} key Key of attribute to convert.\n\t * @returns {module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder}\n\t */\n\tfromAttribute( key ) {\n\t\tthis._from = {\n\t\t\ttype: 'attribute',\n\t\t\tkey: key,\n\t\t\tpriority: null\n\t\t};\n\n\t\treturn this;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Registers what type of non-collapsed marker should be converted.

View-to-model converters are used when external data is added to the editor, i.e. when a user pastes\n * HTML content to the editor. Then, converters are used to translate this structure, possibly removing unknown/incorrect\n * nodes, and add it to the model. Also multiple, different elements might be translated into the same thing in the\n * model, i.e. `<b>` and `<strong>` elements might be converted to `bold` attribute (even though `bold` attribute will\n * be then converted only to `<strong>` tag). Instances of this class are created by\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/buildviewconverter~buildViewConverter}.\n *\n * If you need more complex converters, see {@link module:engine/conversion/viewconversiondispatcher~ViewConversionDispatcher},\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/view-to-model-converters}, {@link module:engine/conversion/viewconsumable~ViewConsumable}.\n *\n * Using this API it is possible to create various kind of converters:\n *\n * 1.

If given conversion would be invalid according to schema, it is ignored.\n *\n * It is possible to provide creator functions as parameters for {@link ~ViewConverterBuilder#toElement}\n * and {@link module:engine/conversion/buildviewconverter~ViewConverterBuilder#toAttribute} methods.

It is possible to change this behavior using {@link ~ViewConverterBuilder#consuming consuming}\n * modifier. The modifier alters the last `fromXXX` query used before it. To learn more about consuming values,\n * see {@link module:engine/conversion/viewconsumable~ViewConsumable}.\n *\n * It is also possible to {@link module:engine/conversion/buildviewconverter~ViewConverterBuilder#withPriority change default priority}\n * of created converters to decide which converter should be fired earlier and which later. This is useful if you provide\n * a general converter but want to provide different converter for a specific-case (i.e. given view element is converted\n * always to given model element, but if it has given class it is converter to other model element).

Currently, it's only responsible for intercepting the `paste` event and\n * passing the pasted content through the clipboard pipeline.\n *\n * ## Clipboard input pipeline\n *\n * The feature creates the clipboard input pipeline which allows processing clipboard content\n * before it gets inserted into the editor. The pipeline consists of two events on which\n * the features can listen in order to modify or totally override the default behavior.\n *\n * ### On {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:paste}\n *\n * The default action is to:\n *\n * 1. get HTML or plain text from the clipboard,\n * 2. prevent the default action of the native `paste` event,\n * 3. fire {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:clipboardInput} with the clipboard data parsed to\n * a {@link module:engine/view/documentfragment~DocumentFragment view document fragment}.\n *\n * This action is performed by a low priority listener, so it can be overridden by a normal one\n * when a deeper change in pasting behavior is needed. For example, a feature which wants to differently read\n * data from the clipboard (the {@link module:clipboard/datatransfer~DataTransfer `DataTransfer`}).\n * should plug a listener at this stage.\n *\n * ### On {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:clipboardInput}\n *\n * The default action is to insert the content (`data.content`, represented by a\n * {@link module:engine/view/documentfragment~DocumentFragment}) to an editor if the data is not empty.\n *\n * This action is performed by a low priority listener, so it can be overridden by a normal one.\n *\n * At this stage the pasted content can be processed by the features. E.g. a feature which wants to transform\n * a pasted text into a link can be implemented in this way:\n *\n *\t\tthis.listenTo( editor.editing.view, 'clipboardInput', ( evt, data ) => {\n *\t\t\tif ( data.content.childCount == 1 && isUrlText( data.content.getChild( 0 ) ) ) {\n *\t\t\t\tconst linkUrl = data.content.getChild( 0 ).data;\n *\n *\t\t\t\tdata.content = new ViewDocumentFragment( [\n *\t\t\t\t\tViewElement(\n *\t\t\t\t\t\t'a',\n *\t\t\t\t\t\t{ href: linkUrl },\n *\t\t\t\t\t\t[ new ViewText( linkUrl ) ]\n *\t\t\t\t\t)\n *\t\t\t\t] );\n *\t\t\t}\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * ## Clipboard output pipeline\n *\n * The output pipeline is the equivalent of the input pipeline but for the copy and cut operations.\n * It allows to process the content which will be then put into the clipboard or to override the whole process.\n *\n * ### On {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:copy} and {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:cut}\n *\n * The default action is to:\n *\n * 1. {@link module:engine/controller/datacontroller~DataController#getSelectedContent get selected content} from the editor,\n * 2. prevent the default action of the native `copy` or `cut` event,\n * 3. fire {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:clipboardOutput} with a clone of the selected content\n * converted to a {@link module:engine/view/documentfragment~DocumentFragment view document fragment}.\n *\n * ### On {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:clipboardOutput}\n *\n * The default action is to put the content (`data.content`, represented by a\n * {@link module:engine/view/documentfragment~DocumentFragment}) to the clipboard as HTML. In case of the cut operation,\n * the selected content is also deleted from the editor.\n *\n * This action is performed by a low priority listener, so it can be overridden by a normal one.\n *\n * At this stage the copied/cut content can be processed by the features.\n *\n * @extends module:core.plugin~Plugin\n */\nexport default class Clipboard extends Plugin {\n\t/**\n\t * @inheritDoc\n\t */\n\tstatic get pluginName() {\n\t\treturn 'clipboard/clipboard';\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * @inheritDoc\n\t */\n\tinit() {\n\t\tconst editor = this.editor;\n\t\tconst doc = editor.document;\n\t\tconst editingView = editor.editing.view;\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Data processor used to convert pasted HTML to a view structure.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @private\n\t\t * @member {module:engine/dataprocessor/htmldataprocessor~HtmlDataProcessor} #_htmlDataProcessor\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis._htmlDataProcessor = new HtmlDataProcessor();\n\n\t\teditingView.addObserver( ClipboardObserver );\n\n\t\t// The clipboard paste pipeline.\n\n\t\tthis.listenTo( editingView, 'paste', ( evt, data ) => {\n\t\t\tconst dataTransfer = data.dataTransfer;\n\t\t\tlet content = '';\n\n\t\t\tif ( dataTransfer.getData( 'text/html' ) ) {\n\t\t\t\tcontent = normalizeClipboardHtml( dataTransfer.getData( 'text/html' ) );\n\t\t\t} else if ( dataTransfer.getData( 'text/plain' ) ) {\n\t\t\t\tcontent = plainTextToHtml( dataTransfer.getData( 'text/plain' ) );\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tcontent = this._htmlDataProcessor.toView( content );\n\n\t\t\tdata.preventDefault();\n\n\t\t\teditingView.fire( 'clipboardInput', { dataTransfer, content } );\n\t\t}, { priority: 'low' } );\n\n\t\tthis.listenTo( editingView, 'clipboardInput', ( evt, data ) => {\n\t\t\tif ( !data.content.isEmpty ) {\n\t\t\t\tconst dataController = this.editor.data;\n\n\t\t\t\t// Convert the pasted content to a model document fragment.\n\t\t\t\t// Convertion is contextual, but in this case we need an \"all allowed\" context and for that\n\t\t\t\t// we use the $clipboardHolder item.\n\t\t\t\tconst modelFragment = dataController.toModel( data.content, '$clipboardHolder' );\n\n\t\t\t\tdoc.enqueueChanges( () => {\n\t\t\t\t\tdataController.insertContent( modelFragment, doc.selection );\n\t\t\t\t} );\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}, { priority: 'low' } );\n\n\t\t// The clipboard copy/cut pipeline.\n\n\t\tconst onCopyCut = ( evt, data ) => {\n\t\t\tconst dataTransfer = data.dataTransfer;\n\t\t\tconst content = editor.data.toView( editor.data.getSelectedContent( doc.selection ) );\n\n\t\t\tdata.preventDefault();\n\n\t\t\teditingView.fire( 'clipboardOutput', { dataTransfer, content, method: evt.name } );\n\t\t};\n\n\t\tthis.listenTo( editingView, 'copy', onCopyCut, { priority: 'low' } );\n\t\tthis.listenTo( editingView, 'cut', onCopyCut, { priority: 'low' } );\n\n\t\tthis.listenTo( editingView, 'clipboardOutput', ( evt, data ) => {\n\t\t\tif ( !data.content.isEmpty ) {\n\t\t\t\tdata.dataTransfer.setData( 'text/html', this._htmlDataProcessor.toData( data.content ) );\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tif ( data.method == 'cut' ) {\n\t\t\t\tdoc.enqueueChanges( () => {\n\t\t\t\t\teditor.data.deleteContent( doc.selection, doc.batch(), { merge: true } );\n\t\t\t\t} );\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}, { priority: 'low' } );\n\t}\n}\n\n/**\n * Fired with a content which comes from the clipboard (was pasted or dropped) and\n * should be processed in order to be inserted into the editor.\n * It's part of the {@link module:clipboard/clipboard~Clipboard \"clipboard pipeline\"}.\n *\n * @see module:clipboard/clipboardobserver~ClipboardObserver\n * @see module:clipboard/clipboard~Clipboard\n * @event module:engine/view/document~Document#event:clipboardInput\n * @param {module:clipboard/clipboard~ClipboardInputEventData} data Event data.\n */\n\n/**\n * The value of the {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:clipboardInput} event.\n *\n * @class module:clipboard/clipboard~ClipboardInputEventData\n */\n\n/**\n * Data transfer instance.\n *\n * @readonly\n * @member {module:clipboard/datatransfer~DataTransfer} module:clipboard/clipboard~ClipboardInputEventData#dataTransfer\n */\n\n/**\n * Content to be inserted into the editor.

Currently, the supported modifications are:\n *\n * * Extending. The selection focus is moved in the specified `options.direction` with a step specified in `options.unit`.\n * Possible values for `unit` are:\n *  * `'character'` (default) - moves selection by one user-perceived character. In most cases this means moving by one\n *  character in `String` sense. However, unicode also defines \"combing marks\". These are special symbols, that combines\n *  with a symbol before it (\"base character\") to create one user-perceived character. For example, `q̣̇` is a normal\n *  letter `q` with two \"combining marks\": upper dot (`Ux0307`) and lower dot (`Ux0323`). For most actions, i.e. extending\n *  selection by one position, it is correct to include both \"base character\" and all of it's \"combining marks\". That is\n *  why `'character'` value is most natural and common method of modifying selection.\n *  * `'codePoint'` - moves selection by one unicode code point. In contrary to, `'character'` unit, this will insert\n *  selection between \"base character\" and \"combining mark\", because \"combining marks\" have their own unicode code points.\n *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by\n *  two characters, called \"surrogate pairs\". Halves of \"surrogate pairs\" have a meaning only when placed next to each other.\n *  For example `𨭎` is represented in `String` by `\\uD862\\uDF4E`. Both `\\uD862` and `\\uDF4E` do not have any meaning\n *  outside the pair (are rendered as ? when alone). Position between them would be incorrect.

In default application, {@link module:engine/view/view view} is converted to {@link module:engine/model/model}.\n *\n * During conversion process, for all {@link module:engine/view/node~Node view nodes} from the converted view document fragment,\n * `ViewConversionDispatcher` fires corresponding events. Special callbacks called \"converters\" should listen to\n * `ViewConversionDispatcher` for those events.\n *\n * Each callback, as a first argument, is passed a special object `data` that has `input` and `output` properties.\n * `input` property contains {@link module:engine/view/node~Node view node} or\n * {@link module:engine/view/documentfragment~DocumentFragment view document fragment}\n * that is converted at the moment and might be handled by the callback. `output` property should be used to save the result\n * of conversion. Keep in mind that the `data` parameter is customizable and may contain other values - see\n * {@link ~ViewConversionDispatcher#convert}. It is also shared by reference by all callbacks\n * listening to given event. **Note**: in view to model conversion - `data` contains `context` property that is an array\n * of {@link module:engine/model/element~Element model elements}. These are model elements that will be the parent of currently\n * converted view item. `context` property is used in examples below.\n *\n * The second parameter passed to a callback is an instance of {@link module:engine/conversion/viewconsumable~ViewConsumable}.

Still, they are document data, by giving\n * additional meaning to the part of a model document between marker start and marker end.\n *\n * In this sense, markers are similar to adding and converting attributes on nodes. The difference is that attribute is\n * connected with a given node (e.g. a character is bold no matter if it gets moved or content around it changes).\n * Markers on the other hand are continuous ranges and are characterised by their start and end position. This means that\n * any character in the marker is marked by the marker. For example, if a character is moved outside of marker it stops being\n * \"special\" and the marker is shrunk. Similarly, when a character is moved into the marker from other place in document\n * model, it starts being \"special\" and the marker is enlarged.\n *\n * Since markers are based on {@link module:engine/model/liverange~LiveRange live ranges}, for efficiency reasons, it's\n * best to create and keep at least markers as possible.\n *\n * Markers can be converted to view by adding appropriate converters for\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher#event:addMarker addMarker} and\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher#event:removeMarker removeMarker}\n * events, or by building converters for {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher}\n * using {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~buildModelConverter model converter builder}.\n *\n * Another upside of markers is that finding marked part of document is fast and easy. Using attributes to mark some nodes\n * and then trying to find that part of document would require traversing whole document tree.

It introduces the Undo and Redo buttons to the editor.\n *\n * Below is the explanation of the undo mechanism working together with {@link module:engine/model/history~History History}:\n *\n * Whenever a {@link module:engine/model/delta/delta~Delta delta} is applied to the\n * {@link module:engine/model/document~Document document}, it is saved to `History` as is.\n * The {@link module:engine/model/batch~Batch batch} that owns that delta is also saved, in\n * {@link module:undo/undocommand~UndoCommand}, together with the selection that was present in the document before the\n * delta was applied. A batch is saved instead of the delta because changes are undone batch-by-batch, not delta-by-delta\n * and a batch is seen as one undo step.\n *\n * After some changes happen to the document, the `History` and `UndoCommand` stack can be represented as follows:\n *\n *\t\t  History                           Undo stack\n *\t\t===========             ==================================\n *\t\t[delta A1]              [batch A with selection before A1]\n *\t\t[delta B1]              [batch B with selection before B1]\n *\t\t[delta B2]              [batch C with selection before C1]\n *\t\t[delta C1]\n *\t\t[delta C2]\n *\t\t[delta B3]\n *\t\t[delta C3]\n *\n * Where deltas starting with the same letter are from same batch.\n *\n * Undoing a batch means that a set of deltas which will reverse the effects of that batch needs to be generated. For example, if a batch\n * added several letters, undoing the batch should remove them. It is important to apply undoing deltas in the reversed order,\n * so if a batch has delta `X`, `Y`, `Z`, reversed deltas `Zr`, `Yr` and `Xr` need to be applied. Otherwise reversed delta\n * `Xr` would operate on a wrong document state, because delta `X` does not know that deltas `Y` and `Z` happened.\n *\n * After deltas from an undone batch got {@link module:engine/model/delta/delta~Delta#getReversed reversed},\n * one needs to make sure if they are ready to be applied. In the scenario above, delta `C3` is the last delta and `C3r`\n * bases on up-to-date document state, so it can be applied to the document.\n *\n *\t\t  History                           Undo stack\n *\t\t===========             ==================================\n *\t\t[delta A1 ]             [batch A with selection before A1]\n *\t\t[delta B1 ]             [batch B with selection before B1]\n *\t\t[delta B2 ]             [   processing undoing batch C   ]\n *\t\t[delta C1 ]\n *\t\t[delta C2 ]\n *\t\t[delta B3 ]\n *\t\t[delta C3 ]\n *\t\t[delta C3r]\n *\n * Next is delta `C2`, reversed to `C2r`. `C2r` bases on `C2`, so it bases on the wrong document state. It needs to be\n * transformed by deltas from history that happened after it, so it \"knows\" about them. Let us assume that `C2' = C2r * B3 * C3 * C3r`,\n * where `*` means \"transformed by\". As can be seen, `C2r` is transformed by a delta which is undone afterwards anyway.\n * This brings two problems: lower effectiveness (obvious) and incorrect results. Bad results come from the fact that\n * operational transformation algorithms assume there is no connection between two transformed operations when resolving\n * conflicts, which is true for example for collaborative editing, but is not true for the undo algorithm.\n *\n * To prevent both problems, `History` introduces an API to {@link module:engine/model/history~History#removeDelta remove}\n * deltas from history. It is used to remove undone and undoing deltas after they are applied. It feels right &mdash; since when a\n * delta is undone or reversed, it is \"removed\" and there should be no sign of it in the history (fig. 1).\n *\n * Notes:\n *\n * * `---` symbolizes a removed delta.\n * * `'` symbolizes a reversed delta that was later transformed.\n *\n *\t\tHistory (fig. 1)            History (fig. 2)            History (fig. 3)\n *\t\t================            ================            ================\n *\t\t   [delta A1]                  [delta A1]                  [delta A1]\n *\t\t   [delta B1]                  [delta B1]                  [delta B1]\n *\t\t   [delta B2]                  [delta B2]                  [delta B2]\n *\t\t   [delta C1]                  [delta C1]                  [---C1---]\n *\t\t   [delta C2]                  [---C2---]                  [---C2---]\n *\t\t   [delta B3]                  [delta B3]                  [delta B3]\n *\t\t   [---C3---]                  [---C3---]                  [---C3---]\n *\t\t   [---C3r--]                  [---C3r--]                  [---C3r--]\n *\t\t                               [---C2'--]                  [---C2'--]\n *\t\t                                                           [---C1'--]\n *\n * `C2r` can now be transformed only by `B3` and both `C2'` and `C2` can be removed (fig. 2). Same with `C1` (fig. 3).\n *\n * But what about that selection? For batch `C`, undo feature remembers the selection just before `C1` was applied. It can be\n * visualized between delta `B2` and `B3` (see fig. 3). As can be seen, some operations were applied to the document since the selection\n * state was remembered. Setting the document selection as it was remembered would be incorrect. It feels natural that\n * the selection state should also be transformed by deltas from history. The same pattern applies as with transforming deltas &mdash;\n * ranges should not be transformed by undone and undoing deltas. Thankfully, those deltas are already removed from history.\n *\n * Unfortunately, a problem appears with delta `B3`. It still remembers the context of deltas `C2` and `C1` on which it bases.\n * It is an obvious error &mdash; transforming by that delta would lead to incorrect results or \"repeating\" history would\n * produce a different document than the actual one.\n *\n * To prevent this situation, `B3` needs to also be {@link module:engine/model/history~History#updateDelta updated} in history.\n * It should be kept in a state that \"does not remember\" deltas that were removed from history. It is easily\n * achieved while transforming the reversed delta. For example, when `C2r` is transformed by `B3`, at the same time `B3` is\n * transformed by `C2r`.
